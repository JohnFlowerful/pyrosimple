# [2.0.0]

This release marks the break between pyrocore-compatible code and new pyrosimple code/behavior. The changes are too numerous
to list individually, but the following are some of the backwards-incompatible changes:

- Overhauled `rtcontrol`'s query parsing engine
- Python 2 support dropped
- New TOML configuration file

If you just want to use the pyrocore tools on python 3 without all the new features, you can use the `release-1.X` branch.
