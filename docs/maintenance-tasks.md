This is just to meant to be a section for useful commands that may not merit a full page.

### Flush all session data to disk

The
[`session.save`](https://rtorrent-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cmd-ref.html#term-session-save)
command saves the changing parts of the session status, that is the
`*.torrent.libtorrent_resume` and `*.torrent.rtorrent files.` The copy
of the original `*.torrent` metafile never changes and is thus left
untouched.

If you want to flush all the session data, call rtxmlrpc as follows:

```
rtxmlrpc session.save
```

This is best done before taking any backups, and after making any big changes.

### Move data for selected items to a new location

This sequence of commands will stop the selected items, move their data, adapt rTorrentâ€™s metadata (session state), and finally starts everything again, followed by removing the items from the tagged view. The order matters and cannot be changed.

```
mkdir -p ~/rtorrent/data/TRK
rtcontrol --to-view trk-to-move alias=TRK realpath=$HOME/rtorrent/data is_complete=yes
rtcontrol --from-view trk-to-move // --yes \
  --stop \
  --spawn "mv {{item.path}} $HOME/rtorrent/data/TRK" \
  --exec "directory.set=$HOME/rtorrent/data/TRK" \
  --flush
rtcontrol -M trk-to-move --alter=remove realpath=$HOME/rtorrent/data/TRK
```
By changing the first `rtcontrol` command that populates the tagged view, you can change this to move data for any [criteria](usage-rtcontrol.md#filter-conditions) you can think of.

## Using tags to control item processing

By using the `--tag` command, it becomes easy to write scripts that will only run once against each item:

```
#! /usr/bin/env bash
guard="handled"
rtcontrol --from-view complete -qohash tagged=\!$guard | \
while read hash; do
    # Do any processing
    rtxmlrpc d.hash "$hash"
    # Mark item as handled
    rtcontrol -q "hash=$hash" // --tag "$guard" --flush --yes
done
```
