XMLRPC Migration
----------------

The syntax of XMLRPC commands changed with rTorrent version 0.8.9,
and continues to change. The old command names and behavior were
replaced with aliases and marked for deprecation, so they still work for now,
but don't rely on that and use the new names instead.

See `XMLRPC Migration`_ in the GitHub wiki for details.
